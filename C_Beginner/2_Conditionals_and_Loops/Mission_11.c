######## Oil Change ########

- You are making an app that should remind you when 
  its the time to change the oil in your car.

- The oil needs to change if the mileage after the last change 
  is over 10000, or if the last oil change has been over 12 months ago.

######## Task: ########

- Take the mileage and months values from input and output 
  "Change Oil", in case the conditions above are satisfied.

- In case its not the time for an oil change, output "OK".

######## HINT: ########

Remember to take the inputs in the correct order, first comes the mileage, then the months. Both are integers.
