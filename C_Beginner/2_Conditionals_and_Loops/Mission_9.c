######## Body Mass Index ########

- The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses your 
  height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. 

######## TASK: ########

- Your program should take the BMI value as a float from input, 
  and output one of the following categories, based in its value:

  In case BMI is below 18.5, output "Underweight".
  In case BMI is over 25, output "Overweight".
  For all other values, output "Normal".
